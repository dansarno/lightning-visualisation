# Lightning Visualisation âš¡

A visualisation of the A* pathfinding algorithm made to look like lightning
travelling from source to sink, similar to this [video of lightning over Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFB4pkLjFCo).

The visualisation can be viewed here: [Lightning Visualisation](https://dansarno.github.io/lightning-visualisation/).

#### Key Bindings
